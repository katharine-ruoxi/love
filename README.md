## To My Love

This website was initially created for my girlfriend, but now I've made it customizable so that you can share it with your own love. For instance, if the name of your love were Simone, and the day you fell in love with her were October 14, 1929 (Guess [who were you?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Paul_Sartre)), your customized URL would be https://fallingloves.com/Simone/1929/10/14 .

The webpage was built using HTML5 canvas and React. In the page, there are falling loves in the background. And yes, I was just trying to play with the phrase "fall in love". (Did you know that Robin Gibb's song ["Boys Do Fall in Love"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boys_Do_Fall_in_Love) was covered by [a Filipino band](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parokya_ni_Edgar) under the title "Boys Do Falling Love"?)

This project was inspired by http://love.hackerzhou.me , and you can read its background story [here](http://hackerzhou.me/2011/11/programmers-romantic-1st-anniversary-website.html) (in Chinese). Unfortunately, the couple broke up eventually, so the page http://love.hackerzhou.me is not available any more, but you can still obtain [its source code](https://github.com/hackerzhou/Love).
