## To My Love

This webpage was initially created for my girlfriend, but now I've made it customizable so that you can share it with your own love. For instance, if the name of your love is Simone, and the day you fell in love with her was October 14, 1929 (Guess [who are you?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Paul_Sartre)), the URL for your own page would be https://stevenliuyi.github.io/love/#/Simone/1929/10/14 .

The page is inspired by http://love.hackerzhou.me , and you can read its background story [here](http://hackerzhou.me/2011/11/programmers-romantic-1st-anniversary-website.html) (in Chinese). Unfortunately, the couple broke up eventually, so the page http://love.hackerzhou.me is not available any more, but you can still obtain [its source code](https://github.com/hackerzhou/Love).
